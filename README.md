###Decision Trees and Random Forests###

Loaded the Heart Disease dataset and split it into training and test sets.

Trained a Decision Tree Classifier and visualized the tree using Graphviz.

Controlled overfitting by limiting the tree depth.

Trained a Random Forest Classifier and compared its performance to the decision tree.

Analyzed feature importances to understand which features influenced predictions.

Evaluated both models using cross-validation for more reliable accuracy estimates.
